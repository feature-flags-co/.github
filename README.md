# feature-flags-co

The co in feature-flags-co means oxygen, we want to inject oxygen into the feature flags technology and feature managment platform to bring a healthy environment to software engineering.

Given our current customer requirements, our core project code is not yet open source, and we may gradually release a working core code base at a later stage.

Our SDK and many smaller plug-ins have been contributed as open source community. These SDKs can also be used without connecting to our remote services by way of Bootstrap profiles.

For now, we're an internatinal team from Europe (Specially France) and China. Our customer are mainly from Europe and China. But we want to be able to contribute as much as possible to software teams around the world.
