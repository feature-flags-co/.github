# feature-flags-co

The co in feature-flags-co means oxygen, we want to inject oxygen into the feature flags technology and feature managment platform to bring a healthy environment to software engineering.

`feature-flags-co` is a Feature Management platform. It provides a Feature flags technology service and a Feature Management service. Technically, we call it `Release as Code`.

On top of `Release as Code`, we are also building an online and offline data feedback and software monetisation system during the release process, to better enable the team to achieve Lean Startup, AB testing and Entitlement management. We now call this `Lean as Code`.

# About open source

Given our current customer requirements, our core project code is not yet open source, and we may gradually release a working core code base at a later stage.

Our SDK and many smaller plug-ins have been contributed as open source community. These SDKs can also be used without connecting to our remote services by way of Bootstrap profiles.

For now, we're an international team from Europe (Specially France) and China. Our customers are mainly from Europe and China. But we want to be able to contribute as much as possible to software teams around the world.

We offer our European customers Feature Management services in a privatised deployment. In China, we currently offer SaaS as our main offering, https://featureflag.co
